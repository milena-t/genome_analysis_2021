## Basic analyses
- Reads preprocessing: trimming + quality check (before and after)
- Genome assembly of Illumina reads
- Assembly quality assessment
- Structural and functional annotation
- Differential expression analyses

## Extra analyses
- Transcriptome assembly
- Mapping of ChIP-seq reads and visulaization
- Calculate the heterozygosity of the genome
- Analyses of long non-coding RNAs
- Assembly with different parameters/software
- Deeper analyses of differential espression analyses: e.g. different comparisons
